## Inspiration 
The initial idea for this project came from a task for a university course, and our curiosity about Lamia, as it is our hometown. While designing the app we focused on the importance of not only orienting in space but also gaining insights about 
the city’s legacy, traditions and sights. 

## Features 
- **Navigation**: Navigating through Lamia becomes very easy through the comprehensive map and direction services available . 
- **Learning**: To find out historical places and cultural attractions, as well as natural events taking place there. 
- **Exploration**: Find out about places to visit, where to taste delicious dishes and where to have a night’s rest. 
- **Chatting**: Ensure you can connect with others and share the stories of your use of the product or services. 
- **Profile Customization**: Join different groups and communities as per your interest and gain access to better features and customization of your account by adding pictures and information. 
- **User Authentication**: Comprehensive access points, mainly the login and registration systems should be secure. 

> **Note:** The present layout is rugged and unsophisticated and will require extensive efforts from the ground-up in the future.
